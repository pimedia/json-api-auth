 == Frequently Asked Questions ==

Thanks to 'mattberg' who wrote the auth controller (https://github.com/mattberg/wp-json-api-auth) initially. I have added few methods and authored it as a WordPress plugin so that it could easily be searched and installed vis WordPress. 

* There are following methods available: validate_auth_cookie, generate_auth_cookie, clear_auth_cookie, get_currentuserinfo

* nonce can be created by calling http://localhost/api/get_nonce/?controller=auth&method=generate_auth_cookie

* You can then use 'nonce' value to generate cookie. http://localhost/api/auth/generate_auth_cookie/?nonce=f4320f4a67&username=Catherine&password=password-here

* Use cookie like this with your other controller calls: http://localhost/api/contoller-name/method-name/?cookie=Catherine|1392018917|3ad7b9f1c5c2cccb569c8a82119ca4fd

For instance, you have a new controller 'events' and want to allow users to post new 'event' using 'add_event' method.
This is how you will call the end point with cookie and post the event with user info:

http://localhost/api/events/add_event/?cookie=Catherine|1392018917|3ad7b9f1c5c2cccb569c8a82119ca4fd

If you want sample code how it can be done, check 'JSON API User' plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api-user/. This Auth plugin is part of JSON API User plugin.
 
= Method: validate_auth_cookie =

It needs 'cookie' var.

http://localhost/api/auth/validate_auth_cookie/?cookie=Catherine|1392018917|3ad7b9f1c5c2cccb569c8a82119ca4fd


= Method: generate_auth_cookie =

It needs `username`, `password` vars. `seconds` is optional.

Then generate cookie: http://localhost/api/auth/generate_auth_cookie/?username=john&password=PASSWORD-HERE

Optional 'seconds' var. It provided, generated cookie will be valid for that many seconds, otherwise default is for 14 days.

generate cookie for 1 minute: http://localhost/api/auth/generate_auth_cookie/?username=john&password=PASSWORD-HERE&seconds=60

60 means 1 minute.


= Method: get_currentuserinfo =

It needs 'cookie' var.

http://localhost/api/auth/get_currentuserinfo/?cookie=Catherine|1392018917|3ad7b9f1c5c2cccb569c8a82119ca4fd
